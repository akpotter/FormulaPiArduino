# FormulaPiArduino
Arduino code to go along with ForumlaPi3 code running on RaspberryPi


This is the code that should run on the Arduino on a Elegoo rover. It talks to the modified FormulaPi code that runs on a RaspberryPi running on the same rover

The modified ForumulaPi code (which is also updated to use Python 3.x) to go with this is here: https://github.com/zlite/FormulaPi3
